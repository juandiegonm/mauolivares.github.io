				<p><em><a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RATest/index.html">RATest</a></em>: A collection of permutation tests (Joint with <a href="https://ignaciomsarmiento.github.io/">Ignacio Sarmiento Barbieri</a>)</p>

				<p><strong>Description:</strong> A collection of randomization tests, data sets and examples. This version considers three main testing problems. The first one concerns with the general testing problem of comparisons of parameters between 2 or more populations, e.g. comparison of means, medians or variances, as well as parameters that depend on the joint
				distribution of populations as in <em><a href="https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.aos/1366138199">Chung and Romano (2013)</a></em>. Second, the description and implementation of a permutation test for testing the continuity assumption of the baseline covariates in the sharp regression discontinuity design (RDD) as in <em><a href="https://academic.oup.com/restud/article/85/3/1577/4583623">Canay and Kamat (2018)</a></em>. Finally, it provides the practitioner with an effortless implementation of a permutation test based on the martingale decomposition of the empirical process for the goodness-of-fit testing problem with an estimated nuisance parameter. An application of this testing problem is the one of testing for heterogeneous treatment effects in a randomized control trial as in <em><a href="/files/HTE_WorkingPaper.pdf">Chung and Olivares (2020)</a></em>.</p>

				<p><strong>Vignettes and Extra Documentation:</strong> Additional information regarding the testing problem of comparison of parameters can be found <a href="/files/permTest.pdf">here</a>. A vignette which illustrates the use of the package in the RDD testing problem is also available <a href="/files/RDperm.pdf">here</a>, and 
				<a href="https://www.r-bloggers.com/ratest-a-randomization-tests-package-is-available-on-cran/">this</a> really cool tutorial on R-Bloggers written by <a href="https://ignaciomsarmiento.github.io/">Ignacio Sarmiento Barbieri</a> ,the co-creator of RATest.</p>
